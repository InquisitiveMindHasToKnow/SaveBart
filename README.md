# SaveBart

SaveBart is an application designed for Android devices. It is a game where a player tries to correctly guess the 4 digit number combination selected by the computer at the beginning from the Random Number Generator API.

The player has 10 attempts to guess the correct combination.

At the end of each guess, the computer will provide one of the following responses as feedback:

    The player had guess the correct number

    The player had guessed a correct number and its correct location

    The player’s guess was incorrect

    **Note that the computer’s feedback should not reveal which number the player guessed correctly

The player wins with a successful guess of the 4 digit combination with guesses remaining.

The player loses if they run out of guesses, if time runs out, or if they decide to reveal the combination before the game ends normally.
